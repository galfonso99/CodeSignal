/* Given a sorted array of integers a, your task is to determine which element of a is closest to all other values of a. In other words, find the element x in a, which minimizes the following sum:

abs(a[0] - x) + abs(a[1] - x) + ... + abs(a[a.length - 1] - x)
(where abs denotes the absolute value)

If there are several possible answers, output the smallest one.

Example

For a = [2, 4, 7], the output should be absoluteValuesSumMinimization(a) = 4.

for x = 2, the value will be abs(2 - 2) + abs(4 - 2) + abs(7 - 2) = 7. */

fn absoluteValuesSumMinimization(a: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    a[(a.len()-1) / 2]
}
